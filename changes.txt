Changes of javaGeom library

javaGeom-0.6.1 (2008-??-??, rev. ???)

Start implementing 3D methods

geom2d:
- splitted curve subpackage into curve and domain subpackages
- fixed clipping of closed curves, and implemented clipping methods in the
	specific class 'CurveUtil' and 'Boundary2DUtil'.
- simplified hierarchy of affine transforms, to keep only one concrete class.
- added method Shape2D.isEmpty()
- lot of rewriting in Box2D:
	+ Box2D does not implement PolygonalShape2D anymore
	+ better support of infinite boxes
- removed Dimension2D (useless)

geom3d:
- added several classes:
	+ Vector3D, Box3D, PointSet3D, and EmptySet3D
	+ /curve: Curve3d, ContinuousCurve3D
	+ /line: StraightLine3D, LineSegment3D
	+ /plane: Plane3D



javaGeom-0.6.0 (2008-03-08, rev. 115)

- changed package hierarchy, by dividing geom2d into several subpackages
- implemented Iterable for PointSet2D and CurveSet2D
- introduced SmoothOrientedCurve2D interface
- curve: add method Curve2D.project(Point2D), different from the method
	Curve2D.getPosition(Point2D), for better computation of curve clipping.
- improved implementation of Hyperbola2D and Parabola2D, and their respective
	arcs
- various code cleanup


javaGeom-0.5.2 (2008-01-17, rev. 93)

- Clipping of smooth curves has been improved
- Function "shape2D.getClippedShape()" have been renamed to
	"Shape2D.clip()", and clipping procedures have been improved
- Replace Math.sqrt() by Math.hypot(), to make computations more robust
- Vector2D is more robust for checking colinearity and orthogonality
- CircleArc2D.getReverseCurve() now returns a circle arc, not an ellipse arc
- Some classes have been renamed:
	Domain2D to GenericDomain2D, 
	AbstractDomain2D to Domain2D, 
	AbstractPolygon2D to PolygonalShape2D
- Deprecate class ContinuousOrientedCurveSet2D, and remove references to it
- add LinearTransforms, and GlideReflection2D


javaGeom-0.5.1 (2007-12-02, rev. 86)

- Use generics for curve set implementations, giving more control on type cast
	and adding more safety 
- Change hierarchy of affine transforms, allowing more control on type of 
	transforms after transform composition 
- Specialize the return type of overloaded methods when necessary 
- Add more controls on the curve collection in CurveSet2D 
- Deprecate class PolarPoint2D 
- Fix bug in polyline path


javaGeom-0.5.0 (2007-10-20, rev. 76)

- Better support for generics
- Change implementation of Bounding box, making it more robust and more generic
- Add fonction to compute polygon centroid
- Add class MultiPolygon2D, for multiply connected polygons
- improve stability and robustness for various functions (point-point 
	distances, affine transform)
- improve implementation of Parabola2D and ParabolArc2D
- introduce Hyperbolic conics (HyperbolaD, HyperbolaBranch2D, and 
	HyperbolaBranchArc2D)


javaGeom-0.4.0 (2007-05-13, rev. 55)

- update to Java 1.5.0 and to generics (finally !)
- add method Curve2D.getReverseCurve() which returns same curve with inverse
	parametrization
- add method ContinuousCurve2D.getAsPolyline(int), to use extract curve
	approximation with a given number of subsegments
- Implements methods in BezierCurve2D and ParabolaArc2D which uses polyline
	approximations


javaGeom-0.3.2 (2007-05-03, rev. 47)

- Introduce ParabolaArc2D
- minor changes in Parabola2D
- Add setter class for geometric classes: Circle2D, CircleArc2D, 
	StraightLine2D, LineSegment2D, Ray2D...
- AbstractPolygon2D now returns an iterator instead of a Point2D array
- Polyline2D and Polygon2D admit better handling of points


javaGeom-0.3.1 (2007-04-22, rev. 45)

- Box2D implements methods for clipping different types of curves
- add method ContinuousCurve2D.getSubcurve(double, double) to extract a piece
	of curve.
- class hierarchy of different classes has been updated
- better support for curve sets, 
- better support for pathIterator of many curves
- fix bugs, in particular in EllipseArc2D and CircleArc2D


javaGeom v0.3.0 (rev. 29)

- The support of some conics have been improved, and Parabola2D is introduced.
- The curve hierarchy have been rewritten, M
- Modifications have been made in the hierarchy of affine transforms.
