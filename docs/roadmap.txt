Roadmap for javageom Library
----------------------------

0.6.3 	(soon) next stable release
		check oriented curves winding angle

0.7.0 	(just after 0.6.x) remove dependencies from Shape2D

0.8.0   (?) create 'data' subdirectory, to separate data and algorithms ?

1.0   	(?) complete implementation for lines, polygons and conics in 2D
		Additional algorithms can be provided, as well as additional shapes.
		Partial support of 3D (lines, polygons) can be provided

Other pending questions:
- keep inheritance from java.awt.geom.Point2D for Points ?
- keep double methods (one with x,y, other with point2D) when using points ?
- introduce finite grids
- line segments with direct access to vertices (like LineObject2D) ?
	Call it Line2D ?
- introduce points in homogeneous coordinates ?


Version numbering:
pattern: javaGeom-x.y.z, or javaGeom-x.y.z-dd
first digit incremented following major refactoring of the code
second digit incremented when many new features are added, or when many
	classes or methods have been changed
third digit is incremented for bug fixes, and addition of small new features
two additional digits can be added for the addition of few bug fixes compared
	to the previous version
